# Demand Side Management(DSM) for Techno Economic Evaluation of Hybrid Energy Systems
The codes demonstate the DSM strategy employed in this article, "https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11020204"

## Definition of terms
**P(t), P(w), P1(t), univ,P(ren), and lt** represents PV power, wind power, load, inverter efficiency, surplus renewable energy, and load shift at time, *t*, respectively


## The DSM code 
The DSM code describes the section 6 in this article: https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11020204
